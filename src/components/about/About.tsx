              Deliver My Tune was born from a passion for music and a desire to
              make music distribution accessible to everyone. Our founder,
              Vibhor Goel, experienced firsthand the challenges and barriers in
              the traditional music distribution process while managing an
              artist. Determined to create a solution, Vibhor envisioned a
              platform that would simplify distribution, ensure fair royalties,
              and provide artists with the control they deserve.

              With a small but dedicated team, Deliver My Tune launched in 2015,
              aiming to revolutionize the music industry. Our journey began with
              the belief that every artist should have the opportunity to share
              their music with the world, without the obstacles and high costs
              traditionally associated with music distribution. Over the years,
              we have grown and evolved, continuously improving our platform to
              meet the needs of our artists.
